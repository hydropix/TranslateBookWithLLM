"""
Repetition loop detection for LLM responses.

This module detects when a model has entered a repetition loop, which typically
indicates the model has exceeded its effective context window or encountered an issue.

    Detect if text contains a repetition loop pattern.

    This is common with thinking models (Qwen, DeepSeek) when context window is too small -
    they enter loops like "I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure..."

    The detection uses different thresholds for:
    - Regular content: stricter detection (fewer repetitions needed)
    - Thinking content: more lenient (thinking models may naturally repeat phrases)

    Args:
        text: Text to analyze
        min_phrase_length: Minimum phrase length to detect (default from config)
        min_repetitions: Minimum number of repetitions to trigger detection (default from config)
        is_thinking_content: If True, uses more lenient thresholds for thinking model output

    Returns:
        True if repetition loop detected, False otherwise
